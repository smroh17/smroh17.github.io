# Project

Follow the [instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md), use this space to document your project for yourself and the graders.

## Names
Sunmin Jennifer Roh, Shoki Ko, Yongjin Jina Chun

## Summary
Everyone in our group has not finished week 10 files. For our required “vanilla” features, Jina will implement her week10 code once finalized into our project files. Jennifer will implement a static check and add support for all the data types that are required. Shoki will work on creating test cases and debugging. For our additional features, we want to implement all the “simple” additions to our code and one usability addition. Each member of our group will implement two features that are worth 5 points which will add up to at least 30 points. Shoki will implement adding an infix function composition operator and making lambdas support multiple arguments. Jina will implement adding multiple sequential definitions and letrec to make recursion more convenient. Jennifer will be adding static checking and one feature from usability, that makes our program more convenient for pattern matching.
